# Habit Streak

HabitStreak is a no-frills web application that allows you to input a habit and mark whether or not you completed it every single day. 

There is one goal--> keep the streak alive.

(What if it was called HabitShark and for every habit you track there's a corresponding habit shark that gets placed behind it and if you ever fail to complete a habit, your streak dies and the habit shark eats you)

Keep the streak alive to survive.

HabitShark.
